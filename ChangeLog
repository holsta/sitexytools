Version 0.3, 5 November 2006

* If /exec.before or /exec.after exist when install.site runs,
	run them at the beginning and at the end of install.site.
* Concatenate pkg_add_list and friends from common, roles and the
	host-specific location instead of one overwriting the
	other.
* Include all the common files in each host-specific tarball. This
	means siteXY.tgz need only be installed on systems that
	have no host-specific tarball (siteXY-<hostname>.tgz) available.
* install.site: Don't link localtime to GMT; Users should be free
	to set their own timezone.

Version 0.2, 10 August 2006
Web: http://mongers.org/openbsd/siteXYtools/0.2

* generate: When no .role-<foo> files exist, don't try to
	run includeRole on "*". Fixes batch runs where no
	hostname is specified.

Version 0.1, 10 August 2006
